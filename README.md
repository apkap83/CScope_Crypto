# CyberScope Assessment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

In order for the application to work, I have also uploaded the API key in the repository within file .env.local

- Of course this would not be the case in a production repository. :-)
